Sanjay Saxena is currently serving as a Developer Advocate for IBM, promoting IBM's
Platform-As-A-Service(PaaS), Bluemix. He has more than two decades of experience as
a system developer on declarative and metadata-driven application development 
frameworks for building MVC-style web and mobile applications. He has also worked on
real-time communications and implemented [WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)
client libraries for Java, C#, Objective-C, and Javascript. He has a deep understanding of
high-level messaging protocols that can be used for pub/sub and point-to-point models.
He is an experienced architect and team leader specializing in object oriented principles,
mobile development, and real-time systems with deep commitment for Open Source.

On a personal note, Sanjay is a husband and a father of two. He loves to ski with his kids
whenever his wife and the back permits. Sanjay loves mentoring young kids and coached both his
daughter's [Odyssey of the Mind](https://www.odysseyofthemind.com/p/) team and son's
[First Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) Robotics team. He is also in a
life long pursuit of learning to mix flavors and spirits to come up with interesting cocktails.
The family follows Bay Area sports teams closely and are super excited about Golden State Warriors!
They are hoping 49ers would be able to turn it around soon.
