I am an impassioned champion of declarative metadata driven application development 
frameworks and real-time communications with deep commitment for Open Source software.
I have deep understanding of high-level messaging protocols that can be used for pub/sub
and point-to-point models. I am an experienced architect and team leader specializing
in object oriented principles, mobile development, and real-time systems.
